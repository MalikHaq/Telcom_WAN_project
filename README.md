# Wide Area Network (WAN) Modeling Project

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and modeling a Wide Area Network (WAN) architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT). The goal is to create an efficient and effective WAN connectivity that optimizes data transmission and minimizes network delays.

## Project Objectives

- Design a WAN architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer
- Optimize data transmission processing and minimize delays
- Enhance WAN connectivity efficiency and reduce unnecessary network traffic

## Key Components

- Routers (routerWAN1, routerWAN2, routerWAN3)
- Switches
- PCs and Laptops
- Smartphones and Tablets
- Access Points (WAP1, WAP2, WAP3)
- DHCP Server

## Network Design

The project includes the following WAN segments:

- WAN_A
- WAN_B
- WAN_C
- WAN_D
- WAN_E

Each segment is interconnected using routers, switches, and various end devices to create a comprehensive WAN architecture.

## Implementation Steps

1. Research and compile networking concepts and terminologies
2. Select necessary hardware and software components
3. Design the network architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer
4. Configure IP addresses, RIP, and DHCP pools for all devices
5. Set up SSID configurations for wireless access points
6. Perform connectivity tests using ping

## Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT)
- IP Addressing
- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Wireless Networking (SSID Configuration)

## Testing

The network's functionality was verified by transmitting 4 packets across various devices, including PCs, laptops, and tablets.

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced security measures
- Explore integration with cloud services
- Optimize routing protocols for better performance
